# üìà Stock Correlation Web App

This is a full-stack web application for computing the correlation between multiple stocks over a given time range. Users can select tickers, specify a date range, and view the correlation matrix directly in the browser. The system fetches historical stock data, caches it, computes the correlation matrix, and serves it via a REST API.

## Features

- üîÅ Correlation matrix calculation for multiple stocks  
- üíæ Redis-based data caching to improve speed and reduce API calls  
- üñ•Ô∏è Interactive frontend to select stocks and visualize results  
- üåê Fully deployed on free-tier cloud platforms

## Live Demo

- **Frontend**: [https://tolmanov.github.io/correlation-proj/](https://tolmanov.github.io/correlation-proj/)  
- **Backend**: [https://correlation-proj.onrender.com](https://correlation-proj.onrender.com)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Redis, yfinance, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS  
- **Deployment**: Render (backend), GitHub Pages (frontend)

## üß† How It Works

1. The user selects a list of tickers and date range in the frontend.
2. The frontend sends a POST request to the backend to compute the correlation matrix.
3. The backend:
   - Checks Redis for cached data.
   - Computes percentage daily change and correlation using `pandas`.
   - Returns the matrix as JSON.
   - Also is capable of caching the data 
4. The frontend renders the matrix with color gradients for easier interpretation.

## Potential improvements
* Add a time-series oriented DB to keep the data local and less dependent on data vendor
* Add a scheduled daily update of the data
* Add an endpoint to clear the cache
* Add a fallback to Yahoo finance in case ticker is not supported
* Add semantic search to retrieve the corresponding ticker

## üìå Limitations

* Free tier cloud deployment [Onrender.com](https://render.com/pricing) only allows 25Mb RAM on Key-Value (Redis alternative), therefore, I am limited with a number of stocks and depth of the data to cache and serve.
* There's no time-series support on Key-Value, therefore blobs of the data are stored on per-ticker basis in the hash table.
* Correlation is calculated using the daily stock returns 
* Every cell is using only window of data available for both tickers (even if the intersecting period is only 10 days)


## API Endpoints

### `GET /`

Health check.

### `GET /tickers`

Returns a list of all cached tickers.

### `POST /cache`

Caches historical closing prices for the requested tickers and date range.

**Payload**:

```json
{
  "tickers": ["AAPL", "MSFT"],
  "start": "2024-01-01",
  "end": "2025-07-01"
}
```

### `POST /correlation`

Calculates the correlation matrix for the given tickers and date range.

**Payload**:

```json
{
  "tickers": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOG"],
  "start": "2024-01-01",
  "end": "2025-07-01"
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "tickers": ["AAPL", "GOOG", "MSFT"],
  "correlation": [
    [1.0, 0.81, 0.93],
    [0.81, 1.0, 0.86],
    [0.93, 0.86, 1.0]
  ]
}
```

## üß™ Local Development

### Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Redis
- Node.js (optional, for static server)

### Backend

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Set Redis URL (in .env or settings file)
export CORR_redis_url=redis://localhost:6379

# Run app
uv run --frozen uvicorn corr.main:app
```

### Frontend

Open `index.html` directly or serve it using a simple HTTP server:
